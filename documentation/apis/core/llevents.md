# `rockhopper.core.llevents`

`llevents` (low level events) provides a series of functions (and one struct) to expose all the capabilities of
Rockhopper, in the simplest form possible.
It is relatively easy to use, but should still be used with caution.

This page provides detailed documentation on how to use each of the possible suspends.
